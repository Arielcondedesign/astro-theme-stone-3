  summary: "üîç We carried out usability tests with 6 users using UX Proximal, identifying confusions in the site architecture. We opted for a clean and modern design, prioritizing usability and aesthetics to attract a young audience. Results: improved bounce rate, conversion and customer satisfaction, boosting sales and retention! üöÄ‚ú® #UX #Design #Results",
  implementation: "The implementation of the project required close collaboration with a freelance developer, who was responsible for adapting my Figma design to the Shopify platform. To streamline this process, a user interface (UI) kit was created that included a number of reusable components. This kit not only facilitated the CSS development of the new style, but also ensured visual consistency across all pages of the site. Through this collaboration and the creation of the UI kit, we were able to implement an attractive and functional design that enhances the user experience and reinforces the brand identity.",
  metrics: "When carrying out a freelance project, it is essential to communicate all the findings made during the research phase to the client. In addition, it is important to make sure that the client is satisfied with the quality of your work and the deadlines. In this case, the redesign was well received by both the client and the users. As part of our sustainability initiative, 250 trees were planted to offset the carbon footprint generated by the production of 2,000 T-shirts. However, as I am not part of the company and have no continuity with this client, I do not have specific data on metrics such as user retention, bounce rate or number of visits. It is a pity not to be able to evaluate the objectives set at the beginning of the project. Despite this, we have seen an increase in the number of followers on social networks, which suggests a positive impact on visibility and interest in the brand.",
  lessons: "The main lesson from this project was the importance of establishing written KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) to measure the scope and impact of changes to the user interface (UI) design. It is essential to clearly define what needs to be achieved and when, in order to achieve the set objectives. This lack of clarity in measurement made it difficult to assess the success of the project and highlighted the need for a solid framework from the outset.",
  conclusion: [
    "The client was momentarily satisfied with the new design, as an increase in sales was observed. However, users are perceptive and can detect when a brand is not transparent or contradicts itself. The commitment to sustainability in this case seemed to be more superficial than strategic. To really be part of the slow fashion movement, it is essential that brands act in accordance with their values and lead by example.",
    "In addition, it is essential to have an internal team that can multiply these values and offer a comprehensive service. This will not only strengthen the brand's authenticity, but will also contribute to building a relationship of trust with consumers, who increasingly value consistency between what is said and what is done.e the site's usability and navigation.",
