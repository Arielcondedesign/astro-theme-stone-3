    summary:
        'üîç We carried out usability tests with 6 users using UX Proximal, identifying confusions in the site architecture. We opted for a clean and modern design, prioritizing usability and aesthetics to attract a young audience. Results: improved bounce rate, conversion and customer satisfaction, boosting sales and retention! üöÄ‚ú® #UX #Design #Results',
    implementation: 'In the implementation phase, I adopted a collaborative and integrated approach to ensure proper execution of the design, working in close coordination with developers and key stakeholders to facilitate accurate and efficient implementation. I meticulously recorded research progress in Confluence, creating a centralised repository of knowledge and maintaining constant communication with the team through regular updates on design progress. I used Figma as the primary platform for creating and maintaining consistent and engaging visual designs, facilitating real-time collaboration. After establishing the design system, I initiated a period of testing and refinement, implementing an agile iteration process through modifications to a dedicated Git branch, which allowed for experimentation and refinement of the design without affecting the core code. Once the improvements were validated, I integrated the changes to the frontend through structured commits, ensuring a smooth transition between the design and development phases and guaranteeing that the design evolved coherently with the needs of the project, optimising usability and end-user experience.',
    implementation2: 'I would like to highlight a key functionality of the project: the geospatial visualisation of IoT devices. This feature takes the form of an interactive map of the city showing the precise location of all connected devices. Each sensor is represented by a dynamic indicator that reflects its operational status in real time. This map interface not only provides an overview of the distribution of the devices, but also gives instant feedback on the operation of each sensor. Users can, at a glance, identify patterns, detect anomalies or monitor the performance of specific areas of the city. Implementing this functionality significantly improves operators ability to manage and respond to changing conditions in the urban environment, facilitating faster and more efficient decision-making based on constantly updated data.',
    metrics:
        'When carrying out a freelance project, it is essential to communicate all the findings made during the research phase to the client. In addition, it is important to make sure that the client is satisfied with the quality of your work and the deadlines. In this case, the redesign was well received by both the client and the users. As part of our sustainability initiative, 250 trees were planted to offset the carbon footprint generated by the production of 2,000 T-shirts. However, as I am not part of the company and have no continuity with this client, I do not have specific data on metrics such as user retention, bounce rate or number of visits. It is a pity not to be able to evaluate the objectives set at the beginning of the project. Despite this, we have seen an increase in the number of followers on social networks, which suggests a positive impact on visibility and interest in the brand.',
    lessons:
        'The development of IoT Nexus revealed key lessons for future technology projects, highlighting the importance of continuous iterative collaboration with the development team and end users, enabling agile and efficient design adjustments. We found that for technology solutions such as IoT Nexus, a B2B go-to-market strategy is significantly more effective and economical than a B2C approach, allowing for strong relationships with corporate customers and reduced acquisition costs. Establishing structured and efficient feedback flows with the development team proved crucial to implement rapid improvements, adapt emerging functionalities and keep the project aligned with market objectives, ensuring a continuous and strategic evolution of the technology solution.',
        conclusion: [
    'Beyond confirming that investing in design makes digital products more memorable for users, we can draw several important conclusions from the IoT Nexus project:',
    'Integrating complex data into intuitive interfaces is crucial for technological adoption in traditional sectors like agriculture.',
    'A user-centered approach from the early stages of development significantly reduces iteration costs and improves final product acceptance.',
    'Transforming quantitative data into qualitative, actionable information is fundamental for democratizing access to advanced technologies.',
    'Flexibility in design and development allows for rapid adaptation to changing market and user needs.',
    'Close collaboration between design, development teams, and stakeholders accelerates the innovation process and improves the final product quality.',
    'Implementing a robust design system facilitates long-term product scalability and consistency.',
    'Effective real-time data visualization can transform decision-making in industries dependent on accurate and timely information.'
