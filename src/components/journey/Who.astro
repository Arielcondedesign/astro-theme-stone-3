              I am a Digital Products and Services Designer at Regeneralia. My work focuses on collaborating with different clients to optimise their processes to achieve triple impact. I like to find ways to improve communication and make things work better.

              Before founding Regeneralia, I worked at FSGROUP Engineering and Marina Digital Project, where I helped improve design systems and user experience. I've learned a lot along the way and I'm passionate about applying that knowledge to make life easier for others.

              I've received some accolades in branding and design, but what really matters to me is being able to contribute to projects that make a difference. I'm here to help others optimise their processes and improve communication, always looking for ways to make things more efficient.
